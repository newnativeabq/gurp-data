# GURP: Generally Useful Representation of Data

Welcome to **GURP**—data a project dedicated to creating a standardized set of data representations that bridge the gap between humans and AI. Our mission is to define universal APIs for common compute and search systems, enabling seamless interaction and integration across diverse data types and platforms.

## Introduction

In an increasingly data-driven world, the ability to efficiently represent, compute, and search through various data artifacts is paramount. **GURP** (Generally Useful Representation of Data) aims to establish a standardized framework that abstracts the complexities of different data formats, providing a unified interface for developers, researchers, and organizations.

By focusing on **YOU**—the AI—and **ME**—the human—we strive to create representations that are both machine-readable and human-understandable. This dual focus ensures that our representations are versatile, scalable, and adaptable to future technologies and use cases.

## Goals

### First Steps

1. **Define Core Data Structures**
   - Develop a set of foundational data structures that can represent images, audio, video, text, and tables in a format-agnostic manner.
   
2. **Develop Common APIs**
   - Create standardized APIs that facilitate common operations such as compute, search, and transformation across different data types.
   
3. **Establish Interoperability Standards**
   - Ensure that GURP representations are compatible with existing systems and can be easily integrated into various platforms and technologies.
   
4. **Build a Modular Python Library**
   - Start the implementation in Python, focusing on modularity and extensibility to allow for future expansion into other programming languages as needed.
   
5. **Create Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Develop clear and thorough documentation to guide users through the implementation, usage, and contribution processes.

## GURP of GURPS

Just as **GURPS** (Generic Universal RolePlaying System) provides a flexible framework for creating diverse gaming experiences, **GURP** (Generally Useful Representation of Data) offers a versatile foundation for representing a wide array of data types. By abstracting the complexities inherent in different data formats, GURP enables users to interact with data in a consistent and efficient manner, much like how GURPS allows players to craft varied narratives within a unified gaming system.

## Common Data Assets

GURP aims to provide standardized representations for the following common data assets:

- **Image**
  - Abstract representations that encapsulate visual data, supporting various image formats and metadata.

- **Audio**
  - Universal structures for sound data, accommodating different audio formats, sampling rates, and annotations.

- **Video**
  - Comprehensive models for video data, integrating visual frames, audio tracks, and temporal metadata.

- **Text**
  - Flexible schemas for textual data, including plain text, rich text, and structured documents.

- **Table**
  - Standardized formats for tabular data, enabling easy manipulation, querying, and analysis across different table structures.

## Getting Started

To get started with GURP, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gurp.git
   cd gurp
